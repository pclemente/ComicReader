Overview
========

**Finally a comic reader for iPad done right! ComicFlow was designed with one goal in mind: providing the best experience for comic fans with large collections.**

ComicFlow is also the first (and only?) open-source comic reader for iPad: the entire source code and graphic assets are available for anyone to look at or contribute. The original repo is hosted here https://github.com/swisspol/ComicFlow, since this repo is not mantained and has been changed to read-only (it hasn't received an update in over 5 years), I decided to resurrect the project to adapt it to new iOS devices and take full advantage of the new processing capabilities. This meant updating the code and syntax to compile in the latest version of Xcode and add cool iOS features like dark mode. It is now completely free and contributions are very welcome to make this App even more awesome.
